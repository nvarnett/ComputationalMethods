How to download the homeworks
-----------------------------

Assuming you've already downloaded and installed [Anaconda](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html), you need to download the notebooks on to your machine, in your Notebooks folder. 

The main question is how to download the homework files. Here's what you do:

1. Navigate to the homework in question, say [Homework 1](https://github.com/panand/ComputationalMethods/blob/master/homework/Homework%201.ipynb)
2. Now the important part: to download the file, click on raw, which takes you to [this page](https://raw.github.com/panand/ComputationalMethods/master/homework/Homework%201.ipynb).

You can save that in your notebooks directory, fire up ipython notebook and away you go.
