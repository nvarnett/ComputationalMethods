In other words, even if the list-object is manipulated by only one of the variables that refers to it, it will remain changed when called by any of the other variables that refer to it. While this generalization holds of lists, it does not hold with strings. Even though s1 and s2 both refer to the same object, namely the string \"testString\", the manipulation of one of the variables does not lead to the manipulation of the external object itself. Otherwise, we would expect the output of <code>print s1, s2</code> to be capitalized.\n",

For example, if the line <code>l1[0] = 'T'</code> is executed before l4 is introduced, then l4 looks identical to l1 and l2. In the chunk of code presented here, however, l4 is set to equal the list of characters in testString *before* testString is capitalized. This shows that a manipulation to a list is only tied to the variables that are linked to it *at the list's instantiation*. In this case, a manipulation of the variable l1 is linked to l4, but the same relationship does not hold of l1's \"sister\" variables to l4. "
